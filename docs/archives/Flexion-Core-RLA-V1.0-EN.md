# Flexion Core RLA V1.0
## Research Laboratory Architecture
### Unified Structural Kernel and Maximal Research Profile

Status: Research Profile  
Base Ontology: Flexion Core V1.2  
Layer Type: Non-State-Extending Research Instrumentation

# 1. Purpose

Flexion Core RLA V1.0 defines the Research Profile of the Flexion Structural Kernel.

The objective of RLA is:

- to preserve the minimal ontological kernel,
- to expose maximal deterministic operators,
- to enable research across all fundamental Flexion disciplines,
- without extending structural state.

RLA does not modify ontology.
RLA extends observation capacity.

# 2. Ontological Kernel (Unchanged from V1.2)

The structural state is strictly:

X(t) = (Δ(t), Φ(t), M(t), κ(t))

Where:

Δ ∈ ℝⁿ     Structural deviation  
Φ ≥ 0       Structural energy (derived from Δ)  
M ≥ 0       Structural memory (monotonic)  
κ ≥ 0       Structural viability  

No additional coordinate is fundamental.

Collapse occurs if and only if:

κ = 0

Genesis creates a new structural instance.

All invariants from Core V1.2 remain binding.

RLA MUST NOT introduce new state variables.

---

# 3. Research Extension Principles

## 3.1 No State Expansion Principle

No research metric may introduce new structural coordinates.

All quantities must be deterministic functions of:

X and its derivatives.

## 3.2 Operator-Only Extension Rule

RLA extends the Core via operators:

- differential operators
- geometric operators
- temporal operators
- boundary operators
- diagnostic operators

Operators do not modify X.

## 3.3 Deterministic Telemetry Guarantee

For identical:

- configuration
- initial state
- Δ input sequence
- dt sequence

All RLA metrics MUST be identical.

## 3.4 Laboratory Mode

RLA defines a laboratory-grade research mode.

Minimal Core execution remains valid without RLA.

---

# 4. Structural Flow Layer (Field-Level Operators)

The Core MUST expose:

F(X) = dX/dt

Optionally:

d²X/dt²

Derived flow metrics:

- ||dΔ/dt||
- d/dt(||dΔ/dt||)
- divergence of flow
- local Jacobian
- spectral radius
- local stability classification

This enables:

- field analysis
- attractor detection
- collapse acceleration studies
- bifurcation analysis

---

# 5. Structural Space Layer

RLA defines a metric on structural space:

ds² = wΔ||Δ||² + wΦΦ² + wMM² + wκκ²

The Core may compute:

- trajectory length
- local curvature
- metric degeneracy indicators
- structural distance to boundary

Space operators must not alter state.

---

# 6. Structural Time Layer

RLA introduces structural time as an operator:

T = 𝒯(Δ, Φ, M, κ)

Core may compute:

- T
- dT/dt
- d²T/dt²
- ∇T
- ||∇T||
- Hessian(T)
- temporal curvature scalar

Temporal metrics are derived only from X.

Time is not a fundamental coordinate.

---

# 7. Collapse Geometry Metrics

RLA must expose:

- κ boundary distance
- Δ norm margin
- Φ margin
- M margin
- minimal margin
- normalized collapse proximity

Optional:

- thin-time indicator
- boundary approach velocity

Collapse definition remains:

κ = 0

No additional collapse gates are allowed.

---

# 8. Structural Reversibility and Regime Metrics

The Core exposes:

- SRI
- SRD
- regime classification
- geometry determinism checks

These remain derived from Δ only.

---

# 9. Risk and Resilience Indices

RLA may compute:

- Structural Stability function ST
- Temporal Resilience Index TRI
- Temporal Stress Index TSI
- Temporal Risk proxy R_T

All indices must be deterministic functions of X and derivatives.

They must not influence evolution.

---

# 10. Telemetry Architecture

RLA defines a maximal telemetry profile including:

- state
- flow
- acceleration
- geometric summaries
- time operators
- collapse metrics
- invariant diagnostics

Telemetry is:

- finite-only
- reproducible
- platform-stable
- non-mutating

---

# 11. Deterministic Research Guarantee

RLA enforces:

- finite arithmetic only
- strict invariant preservation
- no stochastic components
- no hidden state
- no partial mutation

Research computations must not introduce non-determinism.

---

# 12. Architectural Separation

Flexion Core V1.2 defines ontology.

Flexion Core RLA V1.0 defines research instrumentation.

Future theoretical expansion must:

- preserve ontology
- preserve collapse definition
- preserve monotonic memory
- preserve monotonic viability
- preserve deterministic closure

Any violation requires a new major version.

---

# 13. Structural Interpretation

RLA transforms the Core into:

A deterministic structural research laboratory.

It enables:

- Field Theory research
- Time Theory research
- Collapse Geometry research
- Stability and resilience studies
- Multi-scale structural diagnostics

Without altering the structural essence.

---

# 14. What RLA Is Not

RLA is not:

- a trading engine
- a prediction engine
- an optimization system
- a controller
- a domain simulator

RLA is a structural laboratory.

---

# 15. Status

Flexion Core RLA V1.0 establishes
the first maximal deterministic research profile
for the Flexion Structural Kernel.

Ontology remains minimal.
Observation becomes maximal.
